If you used this buildout before and run into any issues then check the
following notes:

 * Simplest upgrade is to just use a clean checkout :)

 * We depend on zc.buildout >= 1.4.1, but can't express this in the
   configuration. Remove 'bin/buildout', the 'parts', the 'eggs' and
   'python-2.x' directories and bootstrap again (see INSTALL.txt).

 * We use 'distribute' by default now, if you ran the buildout before, then
   there will be conflicts which can't be resolved automatically.
   Remove 'bin/buildout', the 'parts', the 'eggs' and 'python-2.x'
   directories and bootstrap again (see INSTALL.txt).

 * If you ran this on Snow Leopard before 2009-09-05, then you got a 32-bit
   version. You need to recreate all modules with C extensions, so basically
   all eggs with C parts like PIL and all Zope installations.
